Concurrent v/s Parallel Processing

what is go routine?? --->while calling function add go ---> go func_name() ---> lightweight application level thread --> Separate indepenent execution and can execute concurrently with other go-routines. ---> managed entirely using go routine schedular.

main go routine vs other go routine :- all other go routine exited before main go routine exits. --> no parent and child processes in b/w.

Anonymous functions in go routine: add "go" keyword in func defination.
