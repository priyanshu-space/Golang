In Go, packages come bundled together as a library called "Standard Library"

**String**

* In Go, a string is a `read-only slice of bytes` that represents sequence of characters encoded in UTF-8.
* It is immutable.
* len(string) gives number of bytes not characters.

* byte vs rune

    * Use byte when dealing with low-level binary data or single-byte ASCII characters.
    * Use rune when working with individual characters in a string, especially when handling text that includes non-ASCII or multi-byte Unicode characters.


* Contains
* ReplaceAll
* Count
